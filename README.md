## 📖 Introduction

**Daily Momentum** is a gamified task management application designed to visualize your daily achievements and motivate personal growth.

Inspired by the progression systems found in RPG games (like *Marvel Future Fight*), this app embodies the philosophy that consistent completion of daily "missions" leads to a powerful future. Just as game characters grow by clearing daily quests, users build their own momentum by completing daily tasks.
